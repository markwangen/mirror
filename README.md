QuickFIX/J
==========

This repository is a unofficial mirror of the Trunk of the Sourceforge QuickFIX/J repository.

The original source code is quite easy to follow and its clean structure makes it quite easy to modify. This project will track a number of experimentations based on the QuickFIX/J [wish list](http://www.quickfixj.org/confluence/display/qfj/Home)
